title: Welcome to my blog
---

As a kid, I have always believed in what I have lost was never mine but as I grew up, I added a new line to the saying- What I have gained was always mine. Blogging is one of those things that I feel I have gained and am probably going to treasure for the rest of my life.

**Who is this optimistic bossman?**

Hi guys! It's me, Preyansh Shah from Mumbai, India. I am a grad student at New York University majoring in Marketing. I have always wanted to start my own blog page and write what I feel about certain things around me. I am so glad my professor (Prof. Joanne Tombrakos) pushed us to start blogging and build this healthy habit!

Coming from a hustling bustling city like Mumbai, New York has welcomed me with open arms. I have had a lot of first-time experiences in this city but unfortunately haven’t been able to document them anywhere properly. Above all, when friends and family ask me about how the new city is treating me, I have so much to say but so little time to describe everything. To be honest, I have not managed to stay connected with my friends either due to busy schedules or the time difference between the two geographies. I wanted to share everything I was doing in this new country with them. Social media limited me to only sharing pictures and videos and never let me share my thoughts and experiences but not anymore.
